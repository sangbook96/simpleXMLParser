Tycho: I&#8217;m not even interested in peeling the Exclusivity onion.&nbsp; The only medicine for these Goddamn maneuvers is to tend a fucking menagerie of consoles so that you can never be flanked by these beasts.&nbsp; Here is our exxxclusive guide to exclusivity - only at Pronny Urcrod Dort Crim. My favorite thing from E3 so far is Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle, and I&#8217;m not makin&#8217; a joke.&nbsp; Well…&nbsp; Anthem, also.&nbsp; But I occasionally move the controllers on a Switch that isn&#8217;t even on, and when I do so, I am iterating a fantasy where I play this unlikely&hellip;

Tycho: Brenna went out and saw Wonder Woman last night, and was enraptured; I am given to understand that evil did not endure.&nbsp; Gabreel only had single problem with the film that I know about, and we had to make it up for the strip. Unless it&#8217;s a movie mostly about Lego shit, seeing a movie with Brenna is… not impossible, per se.&nbsp; I would say it&#8217;s on par with establishing a Lunar Colony.&nbsp; Teams of specialists are activated.&nbsp; Multiple failures intrude on the way to success.&nbsp; Occasionally, there are deaths.&nbsp; But they knew the risks.

Tycho: Battleborn just went free-to-play-but-not-really-it&#8217;s-just-a-perpetual-free-trial-and-alternative-business-model-which-I-can&#8217;t-meaningfully-distinguish-from-f2p, or something, and maybe that&#8217;ll work for them.&nbsp; Games go free with varying levels of success; Star Wars: the Old Republic is often hailed as an optimal example, though it&#8217;s starting to become clear to me that many of my friends are super into ESO.&nbsp; Retail launch for these service-product chimaerae looks more and more like the the disposable first stage of a rocket.

No kiss was forthcoming. Our virtual lives got&hellip;
